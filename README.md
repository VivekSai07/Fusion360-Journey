# Fusion360-Journey
A collection of beginner tutorial exercises and projects created while learning Autodesk Fusion 360.


- **Exercise1, Exercise2, etc.:** These folders contain the `.f3d` files, Sketch Drawing, and sample image for each exercise.

## Getting Started

To view and interact with the files:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VivekSai07/Fusion360-Journey.git
    ```

2. Open Autodesk Fusion 360 and import the `.f3d` files from the respective exercise folders.

## Tutorials

Here are the tools I've learned:

1. **Exercise 1:** Sketching, Extrusion, Pattern
2. **Exercise 2:** Sketching, Extrusion
3. **Exercise 3:** Pipe, Hole, Extrude, Pattern
4. **Exercise 4:** Offset Extrude, Hole, Pattern, Combine
5. **Exercise 5:** Extrude (Offset), Extrude (Cut), Mirror, Construction Axis, Construction Plane, Combine
6. **Exercise 6:** Box, Extrude (Cut), Fillet, Chamfer, Revolve
7. **Exercise 7:** Extrude (2 side), Extrude (Symmetry), Extrude (From Plane), Mirror, Combine
8. **Exercise 8:** Extrude Symmetry, Tangent Line, Construction Lines, Hole, Trim

*(This list will be updated as I complete more tutorials)*
